 Some thoughts on Train Schedule Table: 

Refer to the information from this webpage: http://www.java2s.com/Tutorials/Java/JPA/0330__JPA_ElementCollection_EnumMap.htm

Station A-Z can be stored as enum type. And each train\'92s departure time at each station can be store as Map in java class and a separate table in MySQL DB. 

 In the DB, the TRAIN_SCHEDULE table has three columns: TRAIN_ID, STATION, DEPART_TIME_AT_STATION

Java Code:
enum Station {
	A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z
}


@Entity
@Table(name="TRAIN")
public class Train{
	@Id
	@GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)
	@Column(name="TRAIN_ID")
	private long trainId ; 
 	@Column(name= "BOUND" , nullable= false ) 
	private String bound;
	@Column (name= "DEPARTURE_TIME" , nullable= false )
	private LocalTime  departureTime;
	@Column (name= "TYPE", nullable= false )
	private String type;
	@Column (name= "CAPACITY" ) 
	private int capacity;
	@ElementCollection
	@CollectionTable (name= "TRAIN_SCHEDULE")
	@MapKeyEnumerated (EnumType.STRING)
	@MapKeyColumn(name="STATION")
	@Column(name="DEPART_TIME_AT_STATION")
	privateMap<Station, LocalTime>  trainTimeTable;
}
